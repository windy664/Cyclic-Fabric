<h2> THIS IS NOWHERE NEAR FINISHED! </h2>

![proof image](https://lookimg.com/images/2024/04/15/Qwgdds.png)
<p>An unofficial <b>W.I.P.</b> port of the Cyclic mod for Fabric</p>

Currently focusing on implementing blocks before doing items.

I may port this over to **1.19.2**, however it depends on if there is a decent amount of demand.
If this does happen, it will happen after 1.20.1 is completed/nearly finished.
